For this set of problems, you will create a Python module. The first few problems have you create and test some text manipulation functions. The final problem will require you to combine them into a module and use them in a script. Testing the functions will also require scripts. Save your scripts in files that can be executed outside or inside the IDLE environment (though you can run them from within). Please print out your scripts to pass in along with the responses from the Python interpreter (or IDLE) which you should copy into a document and print out also.
